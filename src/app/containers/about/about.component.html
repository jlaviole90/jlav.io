            This began as a project to learn Angular animations; I've been
            working with Angular for years, but enterprise CRUD apps rarely use
            animations. I figure keeping it (in all its flaws) and using it as a
            resume and portfolio site is better than not having one at all.

            <li>
                The landing page uses a mix of both CSS keyframes and Angular
                animations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The dashboard page is actually 'animated' entirely with
                observables.

                This page is as barebones as possible. Oldschool, reminiscent of
                a better internet.

            My name is Joshua Laviolette. I'm a software engineer by career, and
            overall enjoyer of technical challenges. I've been fascinated with
            learning how things work for as long as I can remember, and
            specifically dealing with computers since I built my first at 14.
            Through networking classes in highschool and getting my Bachelor's
            in Computer Science; my obsession persists even to this day as I
            advance in my career.

            Of course I don't code <i>all</i> the time, I like to get outside
            and touch grass sometimes too.
